Overview
========

<http://rhoiotalambda.azurewebsites.net>

The website is hosted using the **Ghost** blogging engine. This is a tutorial that walks you through the process of adding content to the website.

Admin Site
==========

1.  To begin, you should go to the admin website. This is located at the following URL:

    <https://rhoiotalambda.azurewebsites.net/ghost/>

2.  Login using your username and password.

3.  You should now see the landing page with all of the **Content** for the website.

4.  In ghost, anytime you want to add a piece of content, you simply click the New Post button at the top of the page. Each post can be one of three things:

    1.  **Project Pages**

        For each project, it will create a page for that individual project and show it in the list of projects. For any event or project, I would list it here. Examples include: *Read Across America Day, Project Alpha Meeting, Angel Tree.*

    2.  **Project Pages Also on the Banner**

        There is an option for any project page to feature it on the scrolling banner on the homepage of the site. You select the “featured” option and a post will be featured on the banner. You unselect it to remove an old post from the banner. One example is the *Alpha Day at the General Assembly.*

    3.  **Static Pages**

        You can add static pages to the website simply by adding a page and selecting the option to make it a static page. This is used for pages like *History* and *Membership*.

> In the next sections, we will look at how to add each piece of content. I recommend completing all sections before creating your first pieces of content.

Adding a Project Page
---------------------

1.  On the Admin site, click the **New Post** button.

3.  Now enter the content for the page. On the left-side editor, you can type text and the right-side will show how it will look on the website. For most posts, you can use plain text:

4.  If you are daring, you can use the **Markdown** language to make the blog post look interesting by changing the font and design. Here’s a cheat-sheet and example:

6.  In the **Post Settings** panel, click the **Add post image** link to upload a cover image for the post.

7.  Select an image from your computer and it will upload that image as the cover image for the post.

8.  In the **Post Settings** panel, change the **Post URL** to a url that works for you. In this example we will use **highway-cleanup-june-2016**:

    ![image12](img/media/image12.png)

9.  You can also modify the **Publish Date** to be the date of the actual event. This helps keeps the projects in chronological order.

10. Close the **Post Settings** panel by clicking the **X** button at the top-right corner.

11. Click the arrow next to the **Save Draft** button and select the **Publish Now** option.

Adding a Static Web Page
------------------------

You can also create a page that will appear as a static page on the website and not a project in the list of projects (or animated banner) with these instructions.

1.  Go to the admin page for the website.

    ![image20](img/media/image20.png)

  > This is the same implementation used for the **Membership** and **Chapter History** pages.
