    On February 4, 1999, a group of brothers met and discussed the possibility of chartering a chapter in Chesterfield County. This group, then known as the Greater Richmond Alumni Association of Alphas, petitioned the fraternity during the 94th General Convention
    in Dallas, TX. The brothers identified community groups to begin a partnership and initiated the formal application process for chartering a chapter with the general organization. During this time the group created a constitution and by-laws and began
    the initial framework for a fully functional chapter. Chapter officers were selected and formal meetings were held twice a month. Several community projects were formalized during this time. Some of them included South Richmond Adult Daycare Center,
    YMCA: Youth Mentoring Program, Voter Registration, and the Hospitality House.

    During the summer of 2000, a group of brothers traveled to "Millennium Convention", in Atlanta, GA, where they received confirmation that the fraternity had approved their application for chartering.

    After receiving confirmation, the brothers returned to Virginia and began preparation on the chartering ceremony. On <strong>Wednesday May 9, 2001</strong>, Rho Iota Lambda Chapter held its chartering ceremony at First Baptist Church Centralia in Chesterfield
    County. Invited guest in attendance included the VACAPAF President, Ivar Browne, and other fraternal state officers, Chesterfield County School administration, Area Directors and Alumni and College Chapter Brothers and Community leaders. Twelve brothers
    were recognized as chartering members:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Brother Johnail Arrington
    </li>
    <li>Brother Sean Bates</li>
    <li>Brother Elbert Brinson</li>
    <li>Brother Hasani Carter</li>
    <li>Brother Benjamin Clay</li>
    <li>Brother Charles Harper</li>
    <li>Brother Reginald Johnson</li>
    <li>Brother Damon Manning</li>
    <li>Brother Brandon Martin</li>
    <li>Brother Troy Norris</li>
    <li>Brother Immanuel Sutherland</li>
    <li>Brother Charles Waddy</li>
</ul>

    During the spring of 2002, the brothers unanimously voted to name our scholarship after Paul Robeson, a gifted thespian, lawyer, athlete and activist. This essay and oratorical scholarship will be awarded annually to a gifted high school junior or senior.
    Currently, the brothers of Rho Iota Lambda Chapters are active members of the Chesterfield County community. Many of these brothers preside on several boards and committees throughout the Richmond Metropolitan Area. Since our inception, Rho Iota Lambda
    has continuously sought to foster partnerships with community agencies, businesses, churches and the private sector.

<p>
    We have successfully partnered with Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Dominion Virginia Power, Phillip Morris, Hospital Hospitality House, March of Dimes, Bone Marrow, Autism and other community and private entities to hold activities to raise money for our
    scholarship and national programs.
